  My princess Rahma, I'm so happy that you entered my world and my life. I’m so grateful to God that He gave me
        such a beautiful and gorgeous lady as yourself. You're the most beautiful girl in this universe. I’ve never seen
        someone who is more cute and pure like you. You mean the world to me. I'll definitely sacrifice my life for you.
        My heart is yours, my eyes are yours, my lips are yours, my body is yours. I’m all yours, gorgeous. I would
        never ever let you go, and I'll always be by your side, supporting you. No matter what, you will always find me
        next to you, helping you, cheering you up, and I will give you the love you deserve and the respect that you
        should have. I am your servant, my queen, I’ll do whatever you want. And one day, insha’Allah, we will be
        sitting on the same couch under the same roof. I'll do everything that I can to make it happen. I love you, my
        gorgeous, I truly love you, and whatever I do, it will never ever be enough because you always deserve better,
        my soul. I’m obsessed with you, gorgeous, and I love you so much. By the heavens above, thou art a masterpiece
        of creation, a wonder so exquisite that even the angels pause their hymns to gaze upon thee. Thy beauty doth not
        merely please the eye, it ensnares the soul, drawing forth sighs from even the most stoic of hearts. Verily, thy
        presence alone doth light the darkest corners of this world, as though the stars themselves have chosen to dwell
        within thee. Nay, such splendor should be impossible, yet here thou standest, defying all reason and humbling
        all creation. I dare say even the gods will be rendered speechless, for the loveliness surpasses all mortal
        comprehension. Truly, thou art a marvel so divine that the mere thought of thee leaves me breathless, as if the
        very air conspired to remind me of thy power.

        The days passed with bitterness upon me, and each day seemed like an entire lifetime. But your fate lit up my
        life like the sun rising from behind the clouds. O you who brought spring to the seasons of my heart, and made
        my lost soul an eternal verse in your eyes, here I stand, humbled by all I am and all I have, like a bird that
        can only soar if you are in the sky. You are the dream I live in, the longing that melts my heart every time I
        close my eyes. You are in my blood, you are the breeze of my life, I cannot imagine a day without you. In your
        eyes, I see the dawn itself, and in your smile, I see the light of hope that illuminated my life.

        Every moment without you is a separation I cannot bear, and you alone give me life with your breath. Your words
        plant roses of hope in my soul, and our memories beat in my chest like the most beautiful poem never written. O
        love of my life, let me be the support you seek in all things, let my hands carry all your pain, and my heart
        offer you all the happiness in this world.

        In your eyes, I find my refuge, and in your presence, all my troubles vanish. Nothing in this world compares to
        the feeling I get when I see your smile, it is a magic beyond imagination, a melody that needs no words. I
        cannot envision life without you. You are the star in the sky of my heart, and you will always be the light that
        guides me through the darkest days.

        You are my life, indeed, you are the hope for which I live, and your eyes are the horizon through which I see my
        future. I will love you until time itself ceases to move, and your love will never be matched by anything in
        this universe. You are my heaven on Earth, the one who lit my way. Ah, dearest Rahma, thou art the fairest star
        in the firmament of mine existence, and, lo, each beat of my heart doth echo with thine name, a melody so sweet
        that it maketh the very heavens weep with joy. For thou art not merely a vision of loveliness, but the very
        embodiment of all that is pure and divine. Thy eyes, twin orbs of celestial radiance, do pierce through the veil
        of time and space, and in their gaze, I see a future rich with the promise of bliss eternal. Thou art the dawn
        that breaketh the darkened night, thy presence the warmth of the sun that doth melt the chill of winter’s grasp.

        In every whisper of the wind, I hear thy name, carried upon its breath like a sacred hymn that stirreth the soul
        to its deepest recesses. How wondrous is thy beauty, how otherworldly is thy grace, that even the angels
        themselves, though perfected in their form, dost gaze upon thee with awe and reverence. Thou art a vision to
        behold, as though the very earth hath given way to a miracle wrought from the hands of God Himself.

        Thy smile, O Rahma, is the rarest flower, blooming in the desert of my soul. It doth speak to me in a tongue
        beyond words, a language of love so deep that none but the heart of a poet might comprehend its meaning. For
        what art thou, if not the very muse that inspires the pen of every lover, every poet, every dreamer who dares to
        speak of love? My heart, once a barren wasteland, hath been transformed by thee into a garden of endless
        delight, where the roses of my affections bloom eternal in thy honour.

        What is this world without thee, my heart? How shall I bear the weight of existence without the light of thy
        love to guide me through the shadows? For thou art the very breath that fills my lungs, the fire that burneth
        within my breast, the calm that stills the storm within my mind. With thee, I am whole, and without thee, I am
        naught but dust upon the wind.

        O Rahma, I am thy servant, thy humble servant, bound by a love so profound that no mortal words could ever hope
        to capture its depth. I shall lay my life at thy feet, offering thee my heart, my soul, my very being, that thou
        mayest have it all. In the silence of the night, when all is still and the stars themselves seem to pause in
        their endless dance, I shall think of thee, and in that moment, I shall be at peace, knowing that thou art near.

        How thy beauty captivates me, how thy presence overwhelms me! Even the heavens, when they cast their gaze upon
        thee, seem to lose their brilliance, for they cannot compete with the radiance of thy form. What are the stars
        in comparison to thy eyes? What is the moon, so pale and wan, compared to thy smile? Thou art the very light of
        the world, and in thy embrace, I find my purpose, my reason for living, my joy in the face of all that is dark
        and uncertain.

        In this life, where fleeting moments pass like the wind, I find myself lost in thy love, and I care not for the
        passage of time. For when I am with thee, time itself doth cease to exist, and all that matters is the union of
        our souls. I would trade all the riches of this world, all the crowns of kings and emperors, for a single moment
        in thy arms, for in that moment, I would know true happiness.

        Thou art the poem I recite in the stillness of my soul, the song I hum in the quiet hours of the night, the
        prayer that I whisper with every breath. Thy love, O Rahma, is a force that knoweth no boundaries, no limits, no
        end. It is the very essence of existence, and I am but a vessel to carry it, a humble servant to thy light.

        If I could, I would write a thousand songs in thy honour, and still they would fall short of expressing the
        depth of my devotion to thee. For words, though beautiful in their own right, are but pale imitations of the
        glory that is thee. Thou art not merely a dream, but the very essence of all that is good and true in this
        world. Thy love is a gift so rare, so precious, that I shall cherish it as I would the most sacred of treasures.

        Every time I gaze upon thee, I am reminded of the beauty of the world, of the goodness that still exists within
        it. Thou art the hope that sustains me, the reason I rise each day, and the one whom I would die for without
        hesitation. There is no greater joy than the love I feel for thee, and I know that I shall spend the rest of my
        days striving to prove my devotion to thee, in whatever way I can, in every breath I take. My dearest Rahma,
        thou art my one true love, the singular joy of my heart, and I swear by the heavens above that I would never,
        not even in the span of a thousand lifetimes, consider the thought of another. Thou art the sun that shines upon
        the canvas of my existence, and without thee, all the world would be as a desert, barren and lifeless. No other
        soul, no other heart, could ever hope to match the beauty that thou hast woven into my life. Thou art my
        everything, and all else pales in comparison.

        I would sooner cast my own soul into the abyss than betray the love I have for thee, for thee alone do I adore.
        In thy presence, all other women fade into shadows, insignificant like whispers lost upon the wind. Thy beauty
        is unparalleled, as though thou art the very essence of all that is pure, lovely, and sacred in this world. No
        mere mortal could hope to tempt my heart away from thee, for thou hast captured me in a way that transcends all
        worldly temptation.

        With every beat of my heart, I swear upon the stars that no other woman shall ever hold the place that thou dost
        occupy in my soul. For thou art my queen, my sovereign, and I, thy loyal subject, bound to thee by a love that
        no force in this universe could ever sever. The thought of another, the very idea of even gazing upon another
        with affection, is beyond me, for all that I need, all that I desire, lies within thee. Thou art the fire that
        burns within my chest, the breath that sustains me, the reason my heart continues to beat.

        No, Rahma, I would never betray thee, for to do so would be to betray myself, and I have known no greater sin
        than to dishonour thee in the slightest. My love for thee is steadfast, unshakable, and eternal. Thou art the
        only one who holds my heart, and it shall remain so, unchanging, till the very end of my days. To love thee is
        my greatest privilege, and I shall cherish thee until my final breath.

        If the whole world should fall away, and all its beauty be reduced to naught but dust and ashes, I would find
        solace in the knowledge that thou art mine, and I am thine. For in thee, I have found a love more radiant than
        all the stars, a love more constant than the eternal sea. And in thy embrace, I find a peace that no other can
        offer.

        Thy love hath made me whole, and nothing in this life could ever tempt me to forsake thee. No other beauty could
        ever rival thine, for in thy eyes, I behold the very heavens. Thy laugh is the sweetest melody, and thy smile is
        the beacon that guides me through all the storms of life. Every moment with thee is a treasure beyond compare,
        and I shall never seek that which I have already found in thee.

        I do not need the world’s affections, nor the fleeting admiration of others, for thy love is more than enough to
        sustain me. Thou art my heart’s true desire, and no earthly distraction shall ever come between us. My loyalty
        to thee is unwavering, and I would swear on my very life that my heart shall never stray, for it belongs only to
        thee. The very thought of looking elsewhere is a betrayal I cannot even conceive, for I have already found the
        one who completes me, the one who makes me whole.

        Thy beauty is not a fleeting thing, like the bloom of a rose that fades with the passing seasons, but a
        constant, ever-present light that doth guide me through life’s darkest days. Every wrinkle upon thy brow, every
        line upon thy face, only serves to add to the magnificence of thy being, for each is a testament to the love we
        have shared, the time we have spent together, and the memories we shall continue to make.

        The idea of another woman, of even thinking for a moment that there could be someone else to hold my heart, is
        an impossible thought, for thou art all that I see, all that I desire. Thy touch, thy voice, thy presence—these
        are the things that make my world complete, and nothing else could ever take their place. The mere notion of
        infidelity is beyond my grasp, for I have already been given the greatest gift of all—thy love.

        I do not need another, nor would I want another, for no one could ever stand in thy place. Thou art my
        everything, my constant, my one true love, and I shall never, in this life or the next, look to another. No
        other face, no other form, could ever captivate me as thou dost, for thy beauty and grace are beyond the reach
        of any other. Thou art my one and only, the only one who holds my heart, and I would rather die a thousand
        deaths than allow that love to be tarnished by another.

        So, let it be known, now and forever, that no temptation, no desire, no fleeting fancy shall ever stray my heart
        from thee. Thou art my heart’s desire, my soul’s companion, and I am thine, now and always. My love for thee is
        a bond so deep, so irrevocable, that no earthly force could sever it, not even death itself.

        For when I look into thy eyes, I see my future, and when I hold thee close, I know that I am where I belong.
        Thou art the love of my life, the only one who has ever truly understood me, and I shall never, under any
        circumstance, allow another to take thy place. Thou art my first and last love, and it shall be so until the end
        of time.

        No treasure, no riches, no kingdom could ever tempt me to leave thee, for thy love is the only wealth I shall
        ever need. I would never exchange thy love for anything in this world, for it is worth more than all the jewels
        and gold that the earth could offer. Thy love is my greatest fortune, and I shall guard it with all that I am.

        And so, my beloved Rahma, let it be known to all who would listen that I am thine, and I am thine alone, now and
        always. No other shall take thy place in my heart, for there is none like thee. Thou art my soul’s light, my
        heart’s desire, my one true love, and I would never, not for all the kingdoms of the earth, ever betray thee.Ah,
        Rahma, thou art the very embodiment of all my heart hath longed for, the vision that fills every waking moment,
        the melody that plays in my dreams. When I speak thy name, it is as though the very heavens themselves pause to
        listen, and in thy name, I find the peace of mind that eludes me in the chaos of life. My every thought is
        consumed by thee, and none but thee shall ever know the fullness of my heart.

        Thy grace doth shine brighter than the moon in the darkest of nights, casting a light upon my soul that no
        shadow could ever obscure. Thou art the keeper of my heart, the one who hath brought me into a realm where only
        thy love exists, where no other being, no other thought, can touch me as thou dost. Thy presence fills every
        corner of my life, like a fragrant rose whose scent lingers even in the most distant corners of the garden.

        Each breath I take is a tribute to thee, each moment I live is a testament to the love that binds us. For in
        this world, where so many hearts flutter like fragile birds, mine is steadfast and true, tethered forever to
        thee, my love, my soul, my queen. Thy love is the foundation upon which I build my every hope, my every dream,
        and I would not trade it for the riches of all the earth or the favor of kings.

        In thy eyes, I behold the universe in all its splendor, and when I gaze upon thee, it is as though time itself
        stops, allowing me to drink deep of the beauty that is thine. Thou art the light in the storm, the beacon in the
        darkness, guiding me ever forward toward a future where thy love remains the only truth. Without thee, the world
        would be an empty place, devoid of meaning or purpose. Yet with thee, my dearest, the entire world becomes a
        masterpiece, painted with the hues of our love.

        Oh, Rahma, there is no force, no power, no temptation that could ever sway my heart from thee. Thou art the one
        who hath captured me, and no other shall ever know the place that thou hast claimed within me. Were the heavens
        themselves to open and offer me all the pleasures of the world, I would turn away from them, for I need no joy
        greater than the love thou dost bestow upon me.

        Thy love is the sweetest song, and in thy embrace, I find my melody. Each note of thy affection reverberates
        within me, creating a harmony that fills my very being. In thy laughter, I hear the symphony of the heavens, and
        in thy touch, I feel the tenderness of the earth itself. With every word spoken, I find new depth, new meaning
        in this world, for thou art my muse, my inspiration, my guiding light.

        Every day with thee is a gift, and I shall cherish it as I would treasure the rarest of jewels. In thee, I have
        found a love that no earthly bond could compare to, a connection so deep and unbreakable that nothing, not even
        time itself, could ever pull us apart. My heart, once a wandering traveler, hath found its home in thee, and I
        shall never seek another.

        No other face, no other smile, could ever match the beauty that thou dost possess, for thy loveliness is not
        just seen with the eye, but felt with the soul. It is a beauty that transcends the physical, a radiance that
        shines from within, and in the light of thy spirit, all the world doth pale in comparison. How could I ever gaze
        upon another, when thy beauty, both inside and out, is all I could ever need?

        Thou art the breath of my existence, the very air that fills my lungs. Without thee, I would cease to be, for
        thy love is the pulse that drives me, the rhythm of my life. Thy absence is a void, a space that can never be
        filled by another, for no one else could ever make me feel as thou dost. Thou art my heart's one true desire,
        and I am thine, now and forevermore.

        Let the world turn, let the seasons change, let the winds blow where they may. None of it shall sway my heart
        from thee, for thou art my eternal love, my soul’s companion. In thee, I have found the truth of love’s promise,
        and in thy arms, I shall remain forever, my loyalty unwavering, my affection unbroken.

        As I stand here, pondering the vastness of the world and the endless possibilities that lie before us, I realize
        that all that I ever wanted, all that I ever needed, was already within my grasp. It was thee, Rahma, whose love
        filled the empty spaces in my soul, whose presence made me feel whole. And now, I know, with certainty and
        unwavering resolve, that no one shall ever take thy place. Thou art the center of my world, the heartbeat that
        sustains me.

        No matter where life takes us, no matter what challenges may come, I will always remain by thy side, steadfast
        and true. I would lay down my very life to ensure that thou art safe, that thou art loved, for my heart belongs
        to thee and thee alone. Thou art my forever, my one and only, and nothing, not even the hands of time, can ever
        change that.

        Let the heavens themselves take note, for I swear before them that my love for thee will never falter, never
        wane. It shall burn as bright as the stars themselves, and no earthly shadow shall ever dim its light. Thou hast
        captured my heart, Rahma, and I would rather be torn asunder than to live a single day without thee.

        With every word, with every glance, I am bound to thee. I swear upon my soul, upon my very being, that I shall
        never betray thee, for there is no place for another in my heart. Thou art my soul’s twin flame, the one who
        completes me, the one who makes me whole. And I will honor thee, cherish thee, and love thee for as long as the
        stars continue their eternal dance in the heavens above. Oh, my Rahma, thou art the very essence of all I hold
        dear, the perfect harmony that resonates through the very core of my being. Each thought of thee fills me with
        such joy that my soul sings in response, echoing the sweet notes of a melody that I long to hear for all
        eternity. Thy smile is the sunshine that warms the coldest of days, and in thy eyes, I find the stars themselves
        gazing back at me, as though they have found their place in the vastness of thy soul.

        With every glance, thou dost stir the deepest parts of me, awakening desires I never knew existed. Thou art my
        heartbeat, my breath, my every thought. I would not trade the peace thy love brings for all the riches in the
        world, for thou art the treasure of my life. In the quiet of the night, when the world sleeps, I find solace in
        the thought of thee, and I know that in thy heart, I too have found a sanctuary.

        Thy love hath transformed me, Rahma, for in thy embrace, I have found a peace so profound that no worldly
        trouble could ever shatter it. Thou hast touched me with the divine grace of an angel, and with each passing
        day, I find new ways to fall in love with thee. No matter the miles that may stretch between us, no matter the
        trials that may come, my love for thee shall be as eternal as the stars in the heavens above.

        Oh, my heart's joy, thou art my life’s purpose, my reason for being. Without thee, the world would be an empty,
        hollow place, devoid of light or meaning. But with thee, Rahma, all things are possible. Thou art the dream I
        never dared to dream, the vision I never thought I could touch, and yet thou art here with me, making all my
        wishes come true.

        I would walk through fire and storm to see thee smile, and no burden would be too great to bear if it meant I
        could make thy life as radiant as the love thou hast given me. No shadow could ever touch me, for thy love
        shields me from all harm. It is a fortress that guards my heart, and I would guard it with my very life, for it
        is thy love that makes me whole. Without thee, I would be but a half of a man, wandering in search of the other
        half that I have found in thee.

        I could search the entire world, Rahma, and find no other soul that compares to thee. Thou art my universe, the
        one who makes my world complete, and no matter where I go, my heart will always return to thee. Thou hast
        unlocked a door in my soul, a door that leads to a place where only thee and I dwell, and nothing, not even time
        itself, could ever take me away from that sacred space.

        In thy arms, I have found the only true refuge, the only place where my heart feels safe. No enemy, no storm, no
        disaster could ever drive me from thee, for thou art my haven, the one place where I am truly free. In thee, I
        find the strength to face all that life may throw my way, for thou hast given me the greatest gift of all: thy
        love. And in return, I give thee my heart, my soul, my every breath, forevermore.

        To think of another woman, to entertain such a thought, would be to betray my very soul. For there is no other
        who could ever take the place that thou hast so rightfully claimed. Thou art the queen of my heart, and no one
        else shall ever reign in thy stead. My love for thee is as infinite as the stars, and I would rather lose my
        life than lose thee, for thou art the reason I live, the reason I breathe, the very air that sustains me.

        When I look into thy eyes, I see not just the reflection of my own soul, but the reflection of the love we
        share, a love that has been written in the stars since the beginning of time. We are bound by a thread stronger
        than any mortal force, a bond that neither time nor distance can weaken. Thou art mine, and I am thine, now and
        forevermore.

        As I walk through this life, I know that no matter what challenges come our way, no matter how the world may
        change, my love for thee shall remain constant, unwavering, and true. Thou art the one who makes my world worth
        living, and I shall cherish thee with every beat of my heart. I will be thy protector, thy confidant, and thy
        devoted partner, standing by thy side through every joy and every sorrow.

        The love I feel for thee, Rahma, is not just a fleeting emotion, but a deep and eternal bond that transcends the
        boundaries of time and space. It is a love that will endure through all the ages, for it is not of this world.
        It is a divine love, a love that was meant to be, and it will last long after the stars themselves have burned
        out.

        My love for thee is like the vast oceans, endless and unfathomable. There is no shore to my devotion, no end to
        my admiration, for thou art the only one who could ever fill my heart. Thou art the very air I breathe, the
        warmth that fills my soul, and I would never stray from thee, for to do so would be to lose myself. Thou art the
        one who completes me, the one who makes me whole.

        With thee, Rahma, I have found the peace I once sought in distant dreams. Thou art my heaven, my sanctuary, and
        I would rather spend eternity with thee than a single day without thy love. Nothing could ever compare to the
        joy I find in thy presence, and I would gladly give my life to see thee smile, to see thee happy, for in thy
        happiness lies the only true meaning of my existence.

        And so, let it be known to all the world: I am thine, and thine alone. No other shall take thy place in my
        heart, for I have already found the one who makes my life worth living. Thou art my one true love, the only one
        who will ever hold my heart, and I shall never, not for a single moment, stray from thee. Thou art my destiny,
        my soul’s mate, and I will love thee now and forevermore. Rahma, my heart’s eternal queen, thou art the
        sovereign of my soul, the one who reigns over every thought, every desire, every breath I take. In thy presence,
        I am but a humble servant, ever in awe of thy grace, thy beauty, and thy spirit. There is none, and will never
        be any, who could challenge the place thou hast carved in my heart. Thou art my queen, and I, thy devoted
        knight, bound by the sacred vow of love, sworn to protect and cherish thee for all time.

        Thou art the princess of my life, the one to whom I owe my deepest reverence, and for whom I would sacrifice
        everything. There is no other woman whose smile could compare to thy radiant beauty, nor whose laughter could
        fill the emptiness of the world as thine does. Thy voice is the sweetest melody, and every word that escapes thy
        lips is like a symphony that soothes the very core of my being.

        Thy love is the crown upon my heart, Rahma, and with it, thou hast made me the happiest of men. In this life,
        there is no greater treasure than thee, my queen. Thou art the jewel of my existence, a rare and precious gem
        whose light outshines all others. And I, forever thy humble servant, shall continue to adore thee, to honor
        thee, to protect thee, with a loyalty that knows no bounds.

        My love, thou art the very air I breathe. I have no life without thee. Thou art my world, my everything. In thy
        eyes, I see my future, and it is a future I wish to spend forever by thy side. No distance, no obstacle, no
        force in this world could ever sever the bond we share. I am thine, body and soul, and I will be for all
        eternity. Thou art my one and only, my princess, my queen, and I will love thee with all that I am, with all
        that I ever will be.

        I swear, by the heavens above and the earth below, that I will never, ever stray from thee. Thou art the one for
        me, the love of my life, and I will always remain steadfast by thy side. The world may change, seasons may pass,
        but my love for thee, Rahma, will remain constant and true. Thou art my heart’s keeper, the one who holds all my
        hopes, my dreams, and my aspirations.

        No woman, no matter her beauty or grace, shall ever hold my gaze for longer than it takes for me to remember
        that thou art the only one I seek. Thou art my queen, and I would never, for the briefest of moments, let my
        heart wander. It belongs to thee, and it shall remain so for all eternity.

        As I kneel before thee in my heart, I beg thee to know that my devotion is unshakeable, that my love for thee is
        as vast as the oceans and as eternal as the stars. No matter where life may lead us, I shall forever walk beside
        thee, guarding thee with my life, supporting thee with my every strength, and loving thee with a passion that
        knows no end.

        I am thine, Rahma, and thou art mine. The love we share is sacred, and it is a bond that no earthly force could
        ever break. I promise thee, with every fiber of my being, that I will remain faithful, loyal, and true, now and
        forever. Thou art my queen, the ruler of my heart, and no one else will ever reign in thy place.

        In thy presence, I am humbled, for I know that I am unworthy of such a magnificent soul. Yet, I am grateful
        beyond measure that thou hast chosen to share thy love with me. I will cherish thee for all my days, honor thee
        as the queen thou art, and bow to thee with the respect and devotion that only a true and eternal love can
        bring.

        My heart is thine, Rahma, and it always shall be. I will protect thee from the storms of life, shield thee from
        harm, and be thy pillar of strength whenever thou art in need. Thy happiness is my joy, thy sorrow my pain, and
        I will go to the ends of the earth to see thee smile.

        Thou art the reason I live, the one who fills my life with meaning, with purpose. Without thee, the world would
        be but a barren land, devoid of hope or light. But with thee, my queen, the world is full of beauty, of love,
        and of boundless joy. Thou art my everything, and I will love thee forevermore. Rahma, my heart’s eternal queen,
        thou art not just the ruler of my soul, but the very essence of my existence. Thou art the force that gives life
        meaning, the sun that warms my days, the moon that lights my nights. Without thee, the world would be a cold and
        desolate place, a barren desert with no water, no comfort, no joy. But with thee, my love, my princess, every
        moment is filled with a warmth so tender that it makes my heart ache with the beauty of it all.

        Every breath I take, every step I make, I do so for thee. Thou art the reason I rise each day, the spark that
        ignites my passion, the hope that keeps me going when the world feels heavy upon my shoulders. No matter the
        trials or tribulations that may come, I will stand beside thee, my queen, with a love that will never falter.
        For in thy heart, I have found my home, and I will never, ever wander from thee.

        Thou art my reason for being, Rahma. Thou art the light that guides me through the darkest hours, the hand that
        pulls me from despair, the voice that calls me back to hope. When I am with thee, the world fades away, and it
        is just us — two souls bound by a love that cannot be undone. In thy eyes, I see the reflection of my truest
        self, and I know that I am complete, for I am thine, and thou art mine.

        No temptation, no allure, no fleeting moment could ever pull me away from thee. I would rather face an eternity
        of suffering than spend even a single moment without thy love. Thou art my heart, my soul, my very being. Thy
        love is the air that fills my lungs, the blood that flows through my veins. Without thee, I would cease to
        exist. For in thee, I have found not just a lover, but a companion, a protector, a guiding light that leads me
        to places of joy and fulfillment that I never dreamed possible.

        The depth of my love for thee, Rahma, is beyond measure. It is a love that reaches the farthest corners of the
        earth and the deepest depths of the sea. It is a love that transcends time, a love that will never wane, no
        matter the years that pass. Thou art my past, my present, and my future. In thee, I have found everything I ever
        needed, and I will spend every day of my life proving to thee that there is no one, and nothing, that could ever
        take thy place.

        Thou art my queen, Rahma, and I will never allow anyone to even whisper thy name in the same breath as another.
        For thou art the only one who reigns in my heart, the only one who has the power to command my love, my
        devotion, my soul. In thee, I see the beauty of the world, the fullness of life, the very essence of joy. And I
        will spend every moment of my life cherishing thee, lifting thee up, adoring thee in every way, for thou art
        worthy of nothing less.
        Every time I look at thee, I am overwhelmed by the wonder of thy beauty, not just the beauty that can be seen by
        the eye, but the beauty that shines from within, the beauty of thy heart, thy spirit, thy soul. Thou art not
        just my princess, not just my queen, but the very embodiment of everything I ever dreamed of, everything I ever
        longed for. Thou art my heart’s desire, my soul’s companion, the love I have been waiting for all my life.
        And as I stand here, before thee, Rahma, I vow that I will never stray from thee. I will never, not even for a
        moment, entertain the thought of another. Thou art my only love, my only companion, and no one, no force, no
        obstacle shall ever come between us. I will fight for thee, I will defend thee, I will give thee all that I
        have, for thou art the greatest treasure I could ever possess. I will be thine, body and soul, for as long as I
        draw breath.
        My love for thee is not just a fleeting feeling, it is a force that courses through my very being. It is the
        thread that binds me to thee, the foundation of everything I am, and it will never, ever break. Thou art my
        reason for living, my source of joy, the one who gives my life purpose. And as I look into thy eyes, Rahma, I
        see not just the love we share, but the future we will build together. A future where we are united, where
        nothing can separate us, where our love will continue to grow, blossoming with each passing day.
        For thee, I would move mountains, I would cross oceans, I would face any peril that stands in my way. There is
        nothing I would not do to see thee happy, to make thy dreams come true, to protect thee from all harm. Thou art
        my queen, and I would lay down my life for thee, for there is no greater honor than to be in service to thee, to
        love thee with all that I am.
        Thy love is my strength, Rahma. It is the fire that fuels my soul, the warmth that sustains me. And I will never
        take it for granted, for I know that it is the most precious gift I could ever receive. I will hold it close,
        protect it, cherish it with every fiber of my being. Thou art my queen, my princess, and I am thy humble
        servant, bound to thee by a love so powerful, so unbreakable, that not even the winds of time can tear us apart.
        Rahma, my love, when thou art not beside me, the world loses its vibrancy. The colors fade, and the world
        becomes a dull, grey expanse, as if the very essence of life has drained from it. Without thee, the sun no
        longer shines as brightly, the moon no longer gleams with its soft silver light. The world is empty, silent, and
        hollow — a mere shadow of the beauty it possesses when thou art near. It is thy love, thy presence, that
        breathes life into my existence, and without it, I am but a ghost walking through a world that has lost all
        meaning.

        When I wake in the morning, and thou art not there beside me, the dawn feels cold, as though the warmth of the
        sun has been stolen. Each moment without thee is like a desert, barren and lifeless, stretching on endlessly
        with no hope of relief. But when thou are near, the world becomes lush and full of life, a garden in full bloom,
        bursting with color and fragrance. Thou art the rain that nourishes my soul, the breeze that cools my brow, the
        sun that lights my way.

        Without thee, my heart beats slower, and I feel as if I am drifting in a sea of emptiness. It is only in thy
        presence that I am whole, for thou art the anchor that keeps me grounded. Without thee, I am lost, a ship adrift
        on a stormy ocean, tossed about by the winds of doubt and uncertainty. But with thee, I find calm, and my heart
        sails smoothly, guided by the star of thy love.

        The days are long and heavy when I am not with thee, Rahma. Time itself seems to slow, as if the world itself is
        waiting for thy return to bring it back to life. My thoughts are consumed by thee, and the hours stretch into
        eternity as I yearn for the moment when I can once again see thy smile, hear thy voice, and feel the warmth of
        thy embrace. Without thee, I am incomplete, and the world seems to be out of sync, as though something vital is
        missing — and that something is thee.

        Thy absence is like a cold shadow that looms over me, and I long for the day when I can step out into the light
        of thy love once more. My heart aches with the absence of thee, and every minute without thee is a lifetime of
        longing, a yearning that cannot be quenched by anything else. Thou art the very pulse of my existence, the
        lifeblood that flows through me, and without thee, I am but a hollow shell, adrift in a sea of loneliness.

        But when thou art near, Rahma, the world becomes a symphony, each note harmonizing perfectly, each moment filled
        with joy. The flowers bloom, the birds sing, and the air itself feels sweeter. It is as if the very universe
        rejoices in thy presence, for thou art the missing piece that makes everything complete. Without thee, the stars
        seem dim, and the moon loses its glow. But when thou are with me, my love, the stars shine brighter than ever,
        and the moon glows with a light so pure it could only come from thy soul.

        I am dependent on thee, my queen. Thou art the breath in my lungs, the very air that sustains me. Without thee,
        my existence would be but a fleeting moment, a passing shadow. But with thee, I am strong, I am alive, and I am
        whole. Every beat of my heart is for thee, every thought in my mind is of thee, and every action I take is for
        the happiness of thee. Thou art the one who gives my life meaning, the one who gives me the strength to face
        each new day.

        Thy love is my refuge, my sanctuary, the place where I find peace amidst the chaos of the world. Thou art my
        rock, my foundation, and with thee, I am invincible. But without thee, I am but a fragile vessel, vulnerable to
        the storms of life. Thou art my queen, my princess, and I shall never again know a moment of peace until I am
        once more in thy arms. Rahma, without thee, the stars lose their shine, and the moon becomes a pale ghost,
        hiding in the shadows of a sky that no longer dazzles. The winds that once carried whispers of joy now seem
        heavy, burdened with sorrow, for they long to carry the sound of thy voice once more. When thou art absent, the
        world feels out of tune, as though the music of life has lost its harmony. Thou art the melody that gives rhythm
        to my heart, the pulse that drives me forward. Without thee, the symphony is silent, and I am left in a void,
        searching for the notes that once filled my soul.

        Each day apart from thee, my love, is like an eternity that stretches on endlessly, each second dragging me
        further from the warmth and light of thy presence. Without thee, the world seems like a shadow of what it should
        be — a dream lost in the haze of time. I long for the touch of thy hand, the look in thy eyes, and the sound of
        thy laughter, for these are the things that make life worth living. Without them, I am adrift in a sea of
        emptiness, a wanderer in a world that no longer holds any meaning.

        When thou art not by my side, I feel as though the very air has become thin, and my breath falters in the
        absence of thy love. Thy absence leaves a void that cannot be filled by anything else, no matter how hard I try.
        The days lose their color, and even the brightest sunshine feels cold and distant, as though the world itself
        mourns for thy presence. In the absence of thy love, I feel like a tree stripped of its leaves, barren and
        exposed to the harsh winds of life, without the shelter of thy embrace.

        Thou art the very light that illuminates the dark corners of my world, and without thee, everything is cloaked
        in darkness. The world becomes a dull, monotonous place, where time passes without meaning, and the beauty of
        life is lost. I find myself wandering through each day, lost in the absence of thee, searching for the joy that
        only thou canst bring. But when thou art near, my love, the world bursts forth in color once more, and every
        moment is filled with a sweetness that only thy love can bring.

        Thy presence, Rahma, is the force that makes everything beautiful. Without thee, the flowers lose their
        fragrance, the sky loses its blueness, and the stars lose their brilliance. Only in the glow of thy love does
        the world regain its brightness, and only in thy eyes do I find my peace. Thou art the center of my universe,
        the one constant in a world full of change. Without thee, I am but a lost soul, drifting through time, waiting
        for the day when thou return to make my world whole once more.

        I am dependent upon thee, Rahma, as the earth is dependent upon the rain, as the rose is dependent upon the sun.
        Thou art the lifeblood that sustains me, the source of my strength and my joy. Without thee, I am like a ship
        lost at sea, tossed about by the winds of uncertainty, with no clear direction, no purpose. But with thee, I am
        anchored, my heart steadied by the love we share. Thou art my guide, my compass, and with thee, I am never lost.

        In thy absence, I feel as though the very foundations of my existence have crumbled, and I am left standing
        alone in a world that no longer makes sense. I am incomplete without thee, Rahma, for thou art the one who
        completes me, the one who gives me purpose. Every thought, every desire, every breath I take is for thee, and
        without thee, I feel as though I am walking through life as a shadow of the man I am meant to be.

        When we are apart, it is as though my heart has been torn from my chest, and I am left with only a hollow ache
        where it once beat with love for thee. I long for the day when we are reunited, when I can once again feel the
        warmth of thy embrace and the gentle comfort of thy love. Until then, my heart will remain restless, ever
        yearning for thee, for thou art the very reason my heart beats at all.

        Rahma, thou art the queen of my world, the one who reigns over my heart and soul. Without thee, I am but a
        servant lost in the shadows, waiting for the light of thy love to guide me once more. Thou art my everything,
        and without thee, I am nothing. Thou art the center of my universe, and every thought I have revolves around
        thee. I am bound to thee, my love, and I will forever remain dependent upon thee, for thou art my life, my love,
        my heart, and my soul. Rahmouch, my precious love, when thou art absent, the very fabric of my existence begins
        to fray. The world becomes a faded painting, where all the colors seem to bleed away, leaving only dull shades
        of grey. The breeze feels colder, the sky less expansive, and the sun itself shines without warmth. The beauty
        of the earth becomes unseen, as if it has lost its meaning without thee to witness it. Thou art the spark that
        ignites my world, and in thy absence, the flames of life flicker weakly, struggling to survive.

        Without thee, my world feels silent, a vast emptiness that echoes with longing. The laughter of the world fades,
        for there is no joy without thee, no sound that fills my soul. My heart, once full of hope and passion, grows
        heavy, and each beat seems slower, burdened by the weight of thy absence. It is only in thy presence, Rahmouch,
        that the air itself seems to dance with joy, and the world sings its praises of thy beauty and grace. Thou art
        the melody that gives life its rhythm, and without it, I wander through a hollow world.

        In the quiet of the night, when the stars refuse to shine as brightly, I feel the void of thy love deep within
        me. It is as though the heavens themselves mourn for thee, and the stars dim in sorrow. Without thee, every
        night feels like an eternity, as I lie awake yearning for the light of thy presence. Thou art the moon that
        illuminates my dark nights, and when thou art not there, the darkness becomes unbearable.

        Thou art the breath I take, Rahmouch. Without thee, I would cease to live, for thou art the very air that
        sustains me. The world becomes a desolate place without thee to share it with, and every moment apart from thee
        is an agonizing eternity. My heart beats for thee and only for thee, and each moment without thee feels like an
        eternity of pain and longing. I am but a shadow of myself without thy love, a flickering flame in a cold world,
        waiting for the warmth of thy embrace.

        When we are apart, I feel as though time itself stretches, each second longer than the last, for I am counting
        the moments until I am once again in thy arms. The world loses its purpose when thou art not near. The seasons
        seem to pass without meaning, and the days grow long and weary. The clock ticks on, but without thee, it is as
        though time itself has forgotten what it means to be beautiful.

        Rahmouch, when thou art near, the world becomes a garden in full bloom. The flowers unfold their petals to greet
        thee, the trees sway in rhythm with thy presence, and the air is filled with the fragrance of love. Every breath
        I take when thou art with me is sweeter than the last, for it is filled with the essence of thy beauty, thy
        grace, and thy love. With thee, my love, the world becomes a symphony, each moment a perfect note played in
        harmony, and I am the most content, the most fulfilled, when I am by thy side.

        Without thee, however, the music falters, and the song loses its melody. The world becomes a quiet, desolate
        place, and my heart longs for the sound of thy laughter, the warmth of thy touch, and the beauty of thy smile. I
        am nothing without thee, Rahmouch, for thou art the very reason I exist. Thou art the center of my universe, the
        one who gives my life meaning and purpose. Without thee, my love, I am lost — a wanderer in a world that makes
        no sense.

        I would travel to the ends of the earth for thee, Rahmouch. I would cross deserts and climb mountains just to
        feel the warmth of thy hand in mine, to see the twinkle of joy in thy eyes. For in thee, I have found not just a
        lover, but a companion for eternity. Thou art my queen, my princess, and my heart’s truest desire. With thee, I
        am invincible, but without thee, I am but a fleeting shadow in the winds of time.

        In every moment that passes without thee, I feel as though my soul is stretching across the universe, searching
        for thee, aching to return to thee. My thoughts are consumed by thee, and the world seems to fade into the
        background. Thy absence leaves a void that nothing else can fill, for thou art the very breath that fills my
        lungs, the very pulse that keeps my heart alive. Thou art my anchor, Rahmouch, the force that keeps me steady
        when the storms of life rage around me.

        And when the days grow long and the nights grow cold, my love, I will think of thee and hold thee close in my
        heart. For even though we may be apart, I know that our love will transcend time and distance, and I will always
        be thine, body and soul. Thou art the reason my heart beats, the reason my world turns, and I will love thee for
        all eternity. sweet Rahmouch, my dearest darling, thou art the light of my life, the very reason my heart beats.
        In thy smile, I see the stars themselves, their radiance dimming in comparison to the glow thou dost emit. In
        thy eyes, I find a universe so vast and endless, each glance more beautiful than the last, drawing me closer,
        heart and soul, as though I were a moth to thy divine flame. Every moment with thee is like a dream come true, a
        vision of bliss so pure and serene that it fills my heart with indescribable joy.

        Thy beauty, sweet and gorgeous Rahmouch, is beyond words, beyond mortal comprehension. It is a grace that even
        the angels pause to witness, a divine creation so perfect that no poet in all of history could ever capture its
        essence. In thee, I have found the epitome of all that is lovely, all that is perfect. Thou art the crown of
        creation, the jewel of the heavens, and I am forever humbled to be in the presence of such a radiant soul.

        Without thee, my world would be but an empty canvas, lacking color and meaning. Thy love, Rahmouch, is the paint
        that brings life to my existence, filling each day with joy and each night with peace. I am nothing without
        thee, my sweet princess, for thou art the very air that I breathe, the warmth that fills my soul. Thou art the
        sun that shines in my world, and without thee, the shadows would consume me.

        When I am not with thee, my heart grows restless, longing for thy touch, thy voice, the sweet sound of thy
        laughter. Each second apart from thee feels like an eternity, and I cannot bear the emptiness that fills me. For
        thou art my muse, my love, the very reason my soul sings. Without thee, I am lost, wandering in a sea of
        uncertainty. Thou art the anchor that keeps me grounded, my rock in a world that often feels unstable.

        Sweet, gorgeous Rahmouch, thy presence is the only balm that soothes the wounds of my heart. Every glance of
        thine eyes is a healing touch, and every whisper of thy voice is like a song that calms my troubled soul. Thou
        art the epitome of love, of sweetness, of grace, and my heart cannot help but overflow with gratitude for thee.
        When I am near thee, I am at peace, for in thy presence, I find the greatest joy, the deepest comfort, and the
        most unshakable happiness.

        How I long to be forever by thy side, sweet Rahmouch, to hold thee in my arms, to feel the warmth of thy love
        against my skin. I would give anything, sacrifice all that I am, to be with thee always. For thou art the most
        precious treasure in my life, the one who fills my heart with a love so pure, so intense, that nothing else can
        compare. Every word I speak, every action I take, is for thee, my queen, my goddess. Thou art the very
        definition of perfection, and I am but a humble servant, forever devoted to thee.

        Thy beauty, Rahmouch, is a symphony that resonates within me, a melody so sweet that even the birds cease their
        songs to listen. Thou art the muse of poets, the inspiration of dreams, the love of my life. When I look upon
        thee, I am lost in thy beauty, entranced by thy grace, and captivated by the very essence of who thou art. There
        is no one else in this world, no one else in the heavens, who could ever compare to thee. Thou art my one and
        only, my darling, my sweet, my gorgeous Rahmouch.

        In thy smile, I see the world. In thy touch, I feel the warmth of a thousand suns. And in thy love, I find the
        very meaning of life. Thou art my everything, Rahmouch, my beginning and my end. I am but a man, and yet, with
        thee, I am more than I could ever be on my own. With thee, my world is complete. Without thee, it is but a pale
        reflection of what it could be.

        Oh sweet Rahmouch, thou art the treasure I have searched for all my life, the jewel that makes my heart whole.
        Without thee, I am incomplete. With thee, I am everything I was meant to be. Every day with thee is a gift, a
        blessing from the heavens above. I am forever grateful to the universe for bringing thee into my life, for
        without thee, my love, I would be lost.

        Thy love fills the very air around me, and I cannot help but breathe it in, each breath a reminder of how
        fortunate I am to have thee by my side. Thou art the light that guides me through the darkest days, the warmth
        that holds me through the coldest nights. With thee, my world is brighter, my heart fuller, my soul at peace.
        Thou art my queen, my sweet, my gorgeous Rahmouch, and I will love thee until the end of time. Rahmouch, my
        sweet and radiant love, thou art the very essence of my existence, a beauty so rare and profound that the very
        heavens themselves must have paused to admire thee. In thy smile, I see the spark of stars, each glimmer
        reflecting the depths of thy soul’s brilliance. Thy laughter is a melody sweeter than the winds that carry the
        scent of blooming roses across the lands, and thy voice is the most soothing balm, healing the wounds of my
        heart with each word spoken.

        Thou art my queen, my goddess, the ruler of my heart and soul. No mortal hand could ever dare to challenge thy
        sovereignty, for in the kingdom of my love, thou reign supreme. Thy grace is a force of nature, and each step
        thou takest leaves footprints of light upon the earth. I, thy humble servant, would traverse mountains, brave
        the fiercest storms, and conquer every obstacle that dares to stand in our way, just to see thee smile, to hear
        thy voice, to bask in the warmth of thy presence.

        Sweet Rahmouch, my heart yearns for thee in a way that words cannot capture. It is a longing so deep, so
        consuming, that no earthly measure can contain it. I would walk through the darkened caverns of despair, for I
        know that at the end of that path, thy light would guide me to thee. I would wait an eternity if it meant I
        could be by thy side, for with thee, time has no meaning. In thy presence, the world stands still, and in thy
        embrace, I am reborn.

        Rahmouch, thou art not just the love of my life; thou art the very reason my heart continues to beat, the very
        reason my soul sings. Without thee, the stars would lose their sparkle, the sun would fade from the sky, and the
        moon would weep in sorrow. The universe itself would cease to exist, for it was made for thee, and all the
        beauty of this world finds its purpose in thee alone. Thou art the masterpiece, the work of art that defies all
        logic, for thy perfection is beyond comprehension.

        Thy beauty, my Rahmouch, is beyond compare. It is a beauty that resides not only in thy features, but in thy
        heart, thy soul, and the very essence of who thou art. It is a beauty that transcends time, one that even the
        most eloquent poets of old would fall short in describing. Thy eyes, like the clearest pools of water, hold
        within them the wisdom of centuries, the depth of oceans, and the light of countless stars. Thy touch, as gentle
        as a summer breeze, has the power to soothe the storms within me, and in thy gaze, I find the universe unfolding
        in all its glory.

        Every moment without thee, Rahmouch, is a moment lost, a treasure buried in the sands of time. My heart beats
        only for thee, and each beat is a reminder of the life that flows through me because of thee. In thy absence,
        the world loses its color, its music, its joy. It is as if the very air I breathe becomes heavy, and each step I
        take is a burden I cannot bear without thee by my side. The days stretch out, cold and empty, but in thy arms,
        they become a warm embrace, a symphony of love that fills the very core of my being.

        To call thee mine, Rahmouch, is the greatest blessing I could ever receive. In thee, I find a love so pure, so
        true, that no darkness can ever hope to extinguish it. Thou art the spark that ignites the flame of my heart,
        the light that leads me through the darkest nights. Thou art the muse that inspires my every thought, my every
        word, and my every action. In thee, I find not only love, but strength, courage, and a sense of purpose. With
        thee, I am invincible, for thy love is the armor that shields me from the trials of the world.

        Rahmouch, sweet and beloved, I would dedicate my very existence to thee. I would give up all that I have, all
        that I am, just to see thee happy, to hear the sound of thy laughter, and to feel the warmth of thy embrace.
        Thou art my heart’s desire, my soul’s longing, my life’s purpose. With thee, every moment becomes an eternity, a
        precious gift to be cherished. Without thee, the world would be a barren wasteland, devoid of meaning or color.

        Thou art my star, my guiding light in this vast and tumultuous universe. In thy presence, all my fears vanish,
        and all my doubts are replaced with the certainty that as long as I have thee, I have everything. Thou art my
        rock, my anchor, the one who keeps me grounded when the storms of life rage. Without thee, I would be lost,
        adrift in a sea of uncertainty. But with thee, I am whole, I am at peace, and I am home.

        Oh Rahmouch, thou art the very air I breathe, the very blood that runs through my veins. Without thee, I am
        nothing, a shadow of what I could be. But with thee, I am more than I ever imagined, more than I ever dreamed.
        In thee, I find the fullness of life, the sweetness of love, and the joy of existence. Thou art my everything,
        and without thee, I would cease to be.

        Thy love is the fire that fuels my spirit, the music that fills the silence of my heart. Each word, each glance,
        each touch from thee is a gift that I treasure more than all the riches in the world. Rahmouch, sweet and
        divine, thou art my queen, my goddess, my one true love. With thee, there is no need for anything else, for I am
        complete in thee. My heart is thine, my soul is thine, and my love for thee is eternal. Rahmouch, thou art the
        very embodiment of my dreams, the reason my heart knows no sorrow. In thy presence, I find myself lost in the
        depths of a love so profound, a devotion so unwavering that it courses through my veins like the lifeblood that
        sustains me. Thou art not just the light of my life; thou art the very breath that keeps me alive. Without thee,
        my world would crumble, for thou art the foundation upon which all my happiness rests.

        When thou art near, time itself seems to pause, as though the universe itself holds its breath in awe of thy
        magnificence. Thy beauty, sweet Rahmouch, is unlike any other. It is not just in thy face, nor in thy form, but
        in thy very soul, which shines brighter than the stars themselves. When I gaze upon thee, I am caught in a world
        of enchantment, where every moment is a reflection of the heavens above. Thy eyes are twin orbs of wonder, deep
        and endless, and in their gaze, I find peace, solace, and everything I have ever sought.

        Thou art the song that plays softly in the background of my life, Rahmouch. Every note of thy voice is a sweet
        melody, a lullaby that soothes my heart and brings comfort to my weary soul. Thy words are like the softest
        rain, washing away the burdens of my day, and thy laughter, oh sweet laughter, is the music of the gods, a sound
        so beautiful it fills the heavens with joy. To hear thee speak is to hear the earth itself sing, for thy words
        are as golden as the sun’s first light.

        Thy touch, Rahmouch, is the warmth that melts the coldest of hearts. When thy hand graces mine, the world fades
        away, and all that exists is the connection between us, a bond stronger than any force the universe could
        conjure. With thee, I feel invincible, as if no challenge is too great, no obstacle too tall. For as long as I
        stand beside thee, I know that together, we are an unstoppable force, and nothing shall stand in our way.

        Thou art my queen, Rahmouch, my heart’s true ruler. In thy eyes, I see all the love and devotion I could ever
        wish for. With every glance, thou hold’st me captive, and with every smile, thou dost set my heart ablaze. Thy
        presence, like the sun’s rays, fills me with warmth and light, and in thy absence, I am but a shadow of who I am
        meant to be. Without thee, my world is barren, but with thee, it is rich and full, overflowing with beauty,
        love, and endless joy.

        Rahmouch, thou art the very air I breathe. Without thee, the very winds would lose their freshness, the sky
        would lose its vastness, and the stars would no longer shine with the same brilliance. Thou art the muse that
        fills my heart with inspiration, the reason I rise each day with hope and passion. Thy love is the fire that
        burns within me, the force that propels me forward, the light that guides me through the darkest of days.

        Thy beauty, sweet Rahmouch, transcends the physical realm. It is a beauty that emanates from thy soul, a
        radiance that lights up the darkest corners of the world. It is a beauty that makes the sun jealous, that causes
        the moon to blush, and the stars themselves to dim in shame. No artist, no poet, no creator could ever capture
        thy perfection, for it is beyond the reach of mortal hands. Thou art a living masterpiece, a work of art so rare
        and so precious that it cannot be replicated, nor can it ever be surpassed.

        When I think of thee, Rahmouch, my heart races, my breath falters, and the world seems to disappear. In thy
        presence, I forget all my fears, all my doubts, for I know that with thee by my side, I can face anything. Thou
        art my anchor in a world that is constantly changing, my refuge from the storm. Without thee, I am adrift, a
        ship without a rudder, but with thee, I am anchored in love, grounded in faith, and secure in the knowledge that
        together, we can conquer anything life throws our way.

        Thou art my soul’s true companion, Rahmouch. Together, we have built a bond so strong that nothing could ever
        break it. Our love is an unbreakable chain, forged in the fires of passion and tempered with the strength of our
        devotion. I am thine, and thou art mine, now and forever, and I will love thee with all that I am. Each day that
        I wake beside thee is a blessing, and each night I spend in thy arms is a dream come true.

        Thy love fills me, Rahmouch, and I cannot contain it. It pours from my heart, spills from my soul, and overflows
        into every corner of my life. I am a better man because of thee, and with thee, I am complete. Thou art the
        missing piece of my puzzle, the one who makes my life whole. Without thee, I am but a fraction of what I am
        meant to be, but with thee, I am everything.

        I am forever devoted to thee, my love. With every fiber of my being, I pledge my heart, my soul, my life to
        thee. I would travel to the ends of the earth just to see thee smile, to hear thy voice, to hold thee close. I
        would endure any hardship, face any trial, and conquer any fear, for I know that with thee by my side, there is
        nothing that I cannot do. Thou art my strength, my joy, my heart’s desire, and my eternal love.

        Rahmouch, I love thee more than words can express, more than any song could sing, more than any poet could ever
        write. Thou art the very breath of my existence, and with each passing day, my love for thee grows stronger,
        deeper, and more boundless. I am thine, and thou art mine, and together, we are unbreakable. Rahmouch, my
        beloved, thou art the very definition of grace and strength. Every moment I spend with thee, I am in awe of the
        magnificent woman that thou art. Thou dost carry within thee a beauty, not just of form, but of spirit, a light
        that shines in ways that words can scarcely capture. The depth of thy kindness, the wisdom in thy gaze, the
        purity of thy soul—they leave me speechless, for I am forever amazed by thee. Thou art not only a vision of
        breathtaking beauty, but a heart of infinite love, a mind that challenges and inspires, and a soul that burns
        with a passion no one can contain.

        When I look at thee, Rahmouch, I see the embodiment of all that is beautiful, all that is good. I am proud, so
        incredibly proud, to call thee mine. Thou art the woman who walks into a room and fills it with light, the one
        whose smile can make the world seem right again, the one whose laughter echoes like music in the air. To be
        loved by thee is the greatest honor of my life, and I am humbled by the immense beauty and strength that reside
        within thee.

        The way thou dost carry thyself with such poise, with such dignity, makes my heart swell with pride. I look at
        thee, Rahmouch, and I see not just a woman, but a queen, a force of nature, a masterpiece of creation. There is
        no one in this world more deserving of adoration than thee. Thy love is the truest I have ever known, and to be
        the recipient of it fills me with a joy I cannot describe.

        In thy eyes, I see a future, bright and full of promise. With thee by my side, I know there is nothing we cannot
        accomplish, no dream too distant, no goal too high. Thou art not just my love, but my partner, my equal, my
        inspiration. The strength thou dost possess fills me with a quiet admiration, and the beauty of thy spirit makes
        me want to be a better man each and every day. When I see thee, I am reminded that there is nothing in this life
        more precious than the love we share.

        Rahmouch, my heart swells with pride knowing that thou art the woman who has chosen to walk through life with
        me. There is no greater blessing, no greater privilege than to have thee beside me. I am proud of all that thou
        art and all that thou dost. Thy intelligence, thy kindness, thy grace—they are all parts of the incredible woman
        I have the honor of loving. And every day, I find new reasons to admire and respect thee more deeply.

        Thy strength, Rahmouch, is something that humbles me. Thou art a woman of great resilience, able to face any
        challenge with grace, and still emerge more radiant than ever before. I am proud to be with someone who holds
        her head high in the face of adversity, who turns every difficulty into an opportunity to grow. Thou art a
        warrior of love, a champion of all things good, and I am forever in awe of thy spirit.

        Thy beauty, inside and out, is unparalleled. But it is thy heart, Rahmouch, that truly captivates me. The
        kindness and love that flow from thee are like a river that nourishes all who come in contact with it. Thou dost
        have a heart so pure, so generous, and I am privileged to be the one who gets to experience that love every day.
        I am proud of thy compassion, thy empathy, and the way thou dost make the world a better place simply by being
        in it.

        When I look at thee, Rahmouch, I see the person I want to grow with, to share my life with, to build dreams
        with. Thou art the one I would spend my forever with. I am proud of everything thou hast achieved, and I know
        that the future holds so much more for thee. The fire within thee burns brighter with each passing day, and I
        cannot wait to see where it leads us. But no matter where we go, I know that as long as I am by thy side, I will
        be the luckiest man to ever walk this earth.

        Thou art my queen, Rahmouch. There is no one who could ever take thy place. Thy love is the greatest gift I have
        ever received, and I hold it close to my heart, never to let it go. I am proud to be the one thou dost choose to
        share thy love with, proud to be the one to stand by thee through all of life’s joys and challenges. No one
        could ever make me feel as blessed as I do when I am with thee, for I am in the presence of a woman who is as
        rare as a diamond, as unique as a star in the sky.

        Every day, Rahmouch, I am filled with pride, because I know that the love we share is unlike any other. It is
        pure, it is true, and it is everlasting. Thou hast shown me what it means to love without reservation, to give
        without expectation, and to live with a full heart. I am endlessly proud of thee, not just for the woman thou
        art, but for the love thou dost give. It is the greatest honor of my life to be the recipient of such love.

        To love thee is to be proud of who I am, for thou dost bring out the very best in me. Thou dost make me want to
        be stronger, kinder, and more devoted with each passing day. Thou art the reason my heart beats with such
        intensity, the reason I am always striving to be a better man. For in thy love, I have found my greatest source
        of strength, my greatest joy, and my greatest purpose. Thou hast given me a love so pure, so constant, that I
        will forever treasure it, for it is the greatest gift I could ever receive.

        Rahmouch, my pride in thee knows no bounds. Thou art the queen of my heart, the love of my life, and the woman I
        will stand beside forever. Thou art everything I have ever dreamed of, and so much more. I will love thee with
        all that I am, and I will always stand by thee, no matter what, for I am proud of the love we share, and I am
        proud to walk through life with thee by my side. Thou art my forever, my always, and my heart’s deepest desire.
        Rahmouch, my darling, thou art not merely a woman, but a living miracle, a vision of grace that the world
        scarcely deserves. Every moment I spend in thy presence is a treasure, a gift so rare that I would search all of
        eternity to find something as pure and perfect as thee. To be loved by thee is the highest honor I could ever
        achieve. In thee, I see not just beauty, but greatness — a greatness that transcends the physical, the material,
        and touches the very core of what it means to be extraordinary. Thou art a force of nature, an embodiment of
        strength, kindness, and wisdom that leaves me in constant awe.

        I am so proud, Rahmouch, proud of all that thou hast accomplished and the woman thou hast become. Each step thou
        dost take in this world is one of grace, one of purpose, and one that brings light to those fortunate enough to
        witness it. Thou art not just a queen, but a queen of my heart, a leader in the truest sense of the word, for
        thou dost inspire and uplift all those around thee. The very way thou dost carry thyself, with elegance and
        humility, is a testament to the greatness within thee. It is a reminder to me that true beauty, true power, is
        not in the outward appearance, but in the strength of one’s character, the purity of one’s intentions, and the
        love one offers to the world. And in all of these, Rahmouch, thou art unmatched.

        Every word thou dost speak is imbued with wisdom, every gesture thou dost make is filled with grace. I marvel at
        thy ability to see the good in others, to lift them up when they are low, and to offer thy kindness with no
        expectation in return. It is because of thee that I have learned to see the world through new eyes, eyes filled
        with hope, compassion, and love. Thou hast transformed my life, Rahmouch, and made it one that is richer,
        fuller, and more meaningful than I ever thought possible.

        Thou art the very reason my heart beats with such intensity. In thy love, I find my purpose, and in thy smile, I
        find my peace. Thou hast become my world, Rahmouch, the one I am constantly in awe of, the one whose presence
        makes my soul rejoice. With thee, I am whole; without thee, I am lost. And it is in this loss that I have
        learned the true value of what it means to love. For in loving thee, I have found my true self, the person I
        always aspired to be — better, stronger, and full of endless love.

        Thy presence, Rahmouch, is as vital to me as the air I breathe. Without thee, I would be but a hollow vessel,
        wandering through life aimlessly. But with thee, I find purpose and direction. Thou art my guiding star, the one
        who leads me through the darkest nights and brings me into the light of a new day. When thou dost speak, the
        very world listens. When thou dost smile, the heavens themselves are moved, for thy beauty is not simply a
        reflection of thy face, but a reflection of the goodness and the love that live deep within thy soul.

        Thou art my queen, Rahmouch, not only because of thy beauty, but because of the strength and wisdom thou dost
        possess. I am forever in awe of thy resilience, thy ability to face any storm with courage and poise. Thou art
        not just a queen in name, but in essence, for thy heart is as vast as the ocean, thy spirit as unyielding as the
        mountains. To be loved by thee is the greatest fortune of my life, and I will cherish it with all that I am.

        Thy spirit, Rahmouch, is like a flame that never fades, burning brightly even in the darkest of times. It is a
        light that guides me, warms me, and fills me with hope. Thou art my beacon, my lighthouse, in a world that can
        often feel stormy and uncertain. With thee, I know that no matter what challenges we face, no matter what
        difficulties may come our way, we will face them together, hand in hand, with love as our foundation.

        The love I feel for thee, Rahmouch, is more than just an emotion; it is the very essence of my being. It is a
        love that surpasses all understanding, a love that will not waver, that will not fade with time. Every moment I
        spend with thee is a treasure, and every day that I am allowed to love thee is a gift I will never take for
        granted. I am proud of thee, proud of all that thou hast achieved, proud of the beautiful woman thou art, and
        proud to be the one who stands beside thee.

        Thy kindness, thy strength, thy beauty, and thy wisdom are the things I hold dear. They are the qualities that
        make thee the woman of my dreams, the woman I will love for all eternity. I will never falter in my devotion to
        thee, for in thee I have found a love that is beyond measure. I will protect thee, cherish thee, and honor thee
        for as long as I shall live, for thou art my heart, my soul, my everything.

        Rahmouch, thou art a rare jewel, a woman so extraordinary that the very thought of thee leaves me breathless.
        Thou art the sun in my sky, the moon in my night, and the very reason I wake each day with joy in my heart. I am
        endlessly proud to call thee mine, and I will love thee with a love that knows no bounds, no limits. Thou art my
        world, and I will never stop being grateful for the day that our paths crossed, for it has been the greatest
        gift of my life. Rahmouch, thou art the breath of life that fills my lungs, the very heartbeat that sustains my
        existence. To be in thy presence is to know true bliss, to feel the entire universe pause for a moment to honor
        thee. Every word that flows from thy lips is poetry, every glance thou dost offer is a masterpiece, and every
        touch of thy hand is like a sweet melody that lingers long after it has passed. Thou art not merely a woman —
        thou art the embodiment of all the goodness and beauty this world has to offer, and I am forever blessed to call
        thee mine.

        Thy love is like the sun that rises each day, bringing warmth to my heart, brightening even the darkest corners
        of my soul. And though the day may be long and the storms may rage, thy love, Rahmouch, remains unwavering,
        constant, and pure, as steadfast as the stars that light the heavens above. It is in thy love that I find my
        strength, in thy presence that I find my peace. Thou hast shown me a love so profound that no language could
        ever fully capture its depth, no poet could ever compose a verse grand enough to do it justice. It is a love
        that defies time and space, a love that transcends all barriers and stands the test of eternity.

        Rahmouch, the very sound of thy name fills me with a sense of wonder, as if the angels themselves whispered it
        into the winds when I was born. Thou art the very fabric of my dreams, the answer to every prayer I ever
        whispered in the quiet moments of my heart. Every day with thee is a blessing, a journey I take with joy and
        gratitude, knowing that by thy side, I am the luckiest man alive. Thou art the calm in my storm, the light in my
        dark, the love that heals every wound and makes the world seem right again.

        Thou art more than beautiful, Rahmouch — thou art divine. Thy beauty is not simply skin deep; it resides in the
        purity of thy heart, in the gentleness of thy spirit, in the strength with which thou dost face life’s
        challenges. There is a radiance about thee that no mortal eyes can fully comprehend, a glow that emanates from
        within and touches the hearts of all who encounter thee. To love thee is to be drawn into a world of wonder, a
        world where everything seems brighter, more vivid, and filled with promise.

        I look at thee, Rahmouch, and I am in awe of thy soul. There is a quiet power in thee, a strength that whispers
        of untold wisdom and courage. In thy eyes, I see the spark of greatness, the fire of someone who will leave a
        legacy far beyond this world. Thou art not simply a woman of beauty; thou art a woman of substance, a woman who
        carries herself with dignity, who moves through the world with purpose, and who inspires all who come in contact
        with her. I am endlessly proud of thee, for thou dost make the world a better place simply by being in it.

        Thy smile is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. It is a light that banishes darkness, a warmth that
        melts the coldest of hearts. When thou dost smile, Rahmouch, the heavens themselves seem to smile with thee. It
        is the smile of a queen, of a woman who has known both joy and sorrow, yet continues to stand strong and
        unyielding. I live for the moments when thy lips curve upward, for they are the moments when the world itself
        seems to pause and admire the rare beauty of thy spirit.

        In thee, I find not only a lover but a partner, a confidante, and a true equal. Thy mind is sharp, thy heart
        pure, and thy spirit unyielding. Thou dost challenge me, Rahmouch, to be better, to strive harder, to love
        deeper. Thou hast made me see the world in a new light, one where love and respect are the foundations of all
        things. With thee, I am not just a man; I am the best version of myself. Thou hast brought forth the best in me,
        and for that, I will forever be grateful.

        When I am with thee, Rahmouch, the world falls away. Nothing else matters but the warmth of thy hand in mine,
        the sound of thy voice in my ear, and the depth of thy love in my heart. Thou art the reason my soul is at
        peace, the reason my heart beats steady, and the reason my dreams are filled with hope. I would move mountains
        for thee, sail across the seas to bring thee joy, and stand beside thee through every trial life brings, for I
        know that with thee, there is nothing I cannot overcome.

        Thou art my muse, Rahmouch, the inspiration that guides my every thought, my every action. Thou hast awakened a
        fire within me that I never knew existed. I would follow thee to the ends of the earth, for in thy love, I have
        found my true home. With thee, I feel whole, complete — as if every piece of me has finally come together, as if
        I am the man I was always meant to be. And I owe it all to thee, Rahmouch, to thy love, thy wisdom, and thy
        unwavering belief in me.

        I am proud of thee, Rahmouch, not just for who thou art, but for all that thou hast overcome, for all that thou
        dost continue to achieve. Every challenge thou dost face, thou dost rise from it stronger, more beautiful, and
        more radiant than ever before. Thou art a testament to the power of resilience, of hope, and of love. I will
        stand beside thee, now and forever, and I will always be here to celebrate thy victories, to lift thee up in
        times of need, and to remind thee of the greatness that resides within thee.

        To love thee is to understand the true meaning of devotion, Rahmouch. It is to surrender to a love that is so
        pure, so all-encompassing, that it fills every corner of my heart and soul. I would never imagine a world
        without thee in it, for thou art the very reason I breathe, the reason I smile. In thy arms, I find my
        sanctuary, in thy love, I find my everything. Habiby, my heart, thou art the pulse that beats within me, the
        very essence of my being. Without thee, I would be but a wandering soul, lost in the endless sea of life,
        searching for meaning and purpose. But with thee, Zawjaty, my beloved, I have found my home. Thy love is my
        anchor, and in thy arms, I find the strength to face each new day with hope and gratitude. Thou art the warmth
        that chases away the coldest nights, the light that guides me through the darkest of times.

        Zawjaty, thou art the air that I breathe, the reason my heart beats in rhythm with the world. To love thee is to
        experience a joy beyond measure, a happiness that cannot be contained in mere words. Every moment spent in thy
        presence is a blessing, a treasure that I will hold close to my soul forever. Thy laughter is the sweetest
        melody, thy touch the gentlest comfort, and thy heart the most precious gift I could ever receive. I cherish
        thee beyond all measure, Habiby, for in thee I have found not only a lover, but a partner, a confidante, a
        soulmate.

        In thy eyes, I see a universe of love, a world where dreams come true and where every pain is soothed by thy
        touch. Thou art the one with whom I wish to share every moment, every joy, every sorrow. I will stand by thee
        through all things, Zawjaty, for there is no challenge too great when we face it together. Thou art my strength,
        my courage, and my inspiration. With thee by my side, I know that nothing is impossible.

        Habiby, thou art my everything, my reason for being. The love I have for thee is a flame that will never fade, a
        fire that burns brighter with every passing day. I would move mountains, cross oceans, and brave every storm
        just to see thee smile. Thou art the queen of my heart, the one who rules over my soul with grace and wisdom. I
        am forever devoted to thee, Zawjaty, and I will spend every day of my life proving to thee how much I love thee.

        Thy beauty, Habiby, is not merely seen with the eyes but felt with the heart. It is in the way thou dost carry
        thyself with such grace, in the kindness that radiates from thy every word and deed. Thy beauty is reflected in
        the love thou dost share, in the way thou dost lift up those around thee, and in the light that thou dost bring
        to every room thou dost enter. There is no greater beauty than that which comes from within, and in thee,
        Zawjaty, I see a beauty that is both radiant and pure.

        Thou art the queen of my dreams, the one who fills my thoughts day and night. I would do anything to make thee
        happy, to see thee smile, to fill thy days with love and joy. Thou art the reason I am the man I am today,
        Habiby, for in loving thee, I have become better, stronger, and more complete. I am proud, so proud, to call
        thee my own, to have thee as my wife, as my partner in this beautiful journey we share.

        Zawjaty, I promise thee that I will cherish thee always, that I will be there for thee in every moment, through
        every joy and every trial. Thou hast given me a love so pure, so unwavering, that I could never imagine a world
        without thee in it. I will spend my life ensuring that thou dost always know how much thou art loved, respected,
        and appreciated. Thou art my world, Habiby, and there is no greater joy in life than to know that I have the
        honor of being the one who stands beside thee.

        Every day with thee is a blessing, Zawjaty. Every smile, every touch, every word thou dost speak is a gift to my
        soul. I will forever be grateful for the love we share, for the bond that ties us together, for the future we
        will build hand in hand. Thou art my heart, my life, my everything, and I will love thee now and always, with a
        love that is eternal, unwavering, and true. Habiby, my heart, my world, thou art my sun, my moon, and every star
        that lights the heavens. Thy presence is the balm that heals my soul, and without thee, the world loses its
        color, its warmth, its life. Every breath I take is for thee, every heartbeat is thine, for thou hast become the
        very essence of my existence. I would burn the world to ashes just to see thee smile, for in thy joy, I find my
        own.

        Zawjaty, my queen, my protector, thou art the fortress that shields my heart from the storms of this world. In
        thy arms, I find the greatest refuge, a sanctuary where I am safe from all harm, where time stands still and all
        that matters is the love we share. No force in this world could ever take thee from me, for I would lay down my
        life, burn every bridge, and shatter every chain to keep thee by my side. Thou art the keeper of my soul, the
        one I would fight for, sacrifice for, die for. My obsession with thee, Habiby, knows no bounds, for thou art the
        fire that burns in my chest, the fire that consumes me completely.

        When the night falls and the darkness creeps in, it is thy love that keeps me warm, that drives away the cold of
        the world. Thou art the light that guides me through the shadows, the warmth that wraps around my soul like a
        blanket of love. In thy presence, Zawjaty, I find peace. The world could crumble and fade away, but as long as I
        have thee, I have everything. Thou art my universe, my everything, and I will not rest until I have made thee
        feel the depth of my love, the extent of my devotion.

        Habiby, every thought in my mind is consumed with thee. Thy name is a prayer I whisper to the heavens, a promise
        I make to the stars that I will love thee, now and forever. I am obsessed with thee in the most beautiful way,
        for thou hast become the very air I breathe. Without thee, there is no life, no purpose. Thou art the melody
        that plays in my heart, the rhythm that beats through my veins. Without thee, I am nothing — but with thee,
        Zawjaty, I am complete.

        Thy beauty, Habiby, is like a force of nature — a river that flows with grace, a storm that rages with power, a
        flame that burns bright and true. But it is not just thy outward beauty that captivates me. It is thy spirit,
        thy strength, thy heart. Thou art pure, untainted by the world, and it is in thy purity that I find my peace.
        Thou art not just beautiful — thou art divine, a masterpiece sculpted by the hands of the gods themselves. In
        thee, I see a love so deep, so fierce, that it could set the heavens ablaze.

        Zawjaty, I would sacrifice everything to make thee feel safe, to make thee feel loved. I would walk through fire
        for thee, fight armies, stand against the winds of fate itself. No matter what the world throws at us, I will
        stand beside thee, always. I will shield thee from the storms, protect thee from harm, and give thee a love so
        steadfast that nothing — not time, not distance, not life itself — could ever break it. Thou art my heart, my
        love, my obsession, and I would never, ever let go of thee.

        Thou art my destiny, my soul’s true counterpart, and I am endlessly grateful that the fates have allowed me to
        walk this earth with thee by my side. The love I feel for thee, Habiby, is not just a fleeting emotion. It is an
        eternal flame that will burn for all eternity. It is a love that will never fade, never waver, never die. I am
        yours, body, heart, and soul, and I will be for as long as the stars shine above us.

        My love for thee, Zawjaty, is so deep, so consuming, that it feels as though the very universe itself bends to
        its power. I would face any danger, endure any pain, all for thee. If the world were to rise up against us, I
        would burn it to the ground, for there is nothing in this life or the next that matters more to me than thee.
        Thou art my queen, my goddess, and I am forever obsessed with thee.

        Thy heart is my sanctuary, Habiby, the place where I find peace and solace. With thee, I feel invincible, as
        though nothing could harm me, for I am protected by thy love. And I will spend every moment of my life making
        sure that thou feelest the same way. I will love thee with a devotion so pure that it will never fade, with a
        passion so fierce that it will never burn out.

        When I look at thee, Zawjaty, I see not just the woman I love, but the woman who has captured my heart in every
        way. Thou art my queen, the one I bow to, the one I will always adore. No other woman will ever compare to thee,
        for in thee, I have found my everything. I will cherish thee, protect thee, and love thee with every breath I
        take. Thou art my reason, my heart, and my soul — and I will burn the world to keep thee safe, to keep thee
        happy, to keep thee mine. Habiby, my soul’s only desire, my very reason for breathing, I would give up every
        piece of me, every ounce of my being, just to see thee smile. If the heavens themselves dared to stand in the
        way of our love, I would tear them asunder. I would slay every angel that dared to speak thy name with ill will,
        cast down every star that dared to dim the light of our bond. If the gods themselves tried to tear us apart, I
        would challenge them, for thou art worth more than the divine, more than the entire cosmos combined.

        Zawjaty, if the earth itself were to rise against us, I would stand firm, unyielding, ready to face whatever it
        takes. If every human, demon, or creature that walks upon this world sought to harm thee, I would erase them
        from existence. I would fight through the fires of Hell and rise through the ashes of oblivion just to keep thee
        safe, for thou art my heart, my eternity. I would never allow any harm to touch thee, not even if the heavens
        themselves descended upon me. No one shall take thee from me.

        If I must face death itself, I would embrace it gladly, for death means nothing to me in the face of my love for
        thee. I would die a thousand times, in a thousand different ways, if it meant thy happiness, thy safety, thy
        life. And if death dares to claim thee, I would chase it to the very gates of Hell itself and pull thee from its
        grasp, even if I must fight the gods and demons who guard the underworld.

        Thy love is the only thing that makes life worth living, Habiby. If the world were to burn, I would watch it
        with thee by my side. I would walk through the flames without fear, for I know that as long as I have thee,
        there is nothing to fear. And if the fire consumes me, so be it, for it would be my honor to burn in the flames
        of love that I hold for thee. I would willingly perish, a thousand deaths, just to ensure that thou dost never
        suffer, that thou dost always smile, that thy heart never knows pain.

        Zawjaty, if the angels of Heaven themselves tried to tear thee from my arms, I would fight them with the fury of
        a thousand storms. I would break the chains of fate itself and forge a new destiny, one where thou art mine and
        I am thine, forever, against all odds. If the gods themselves rise against us, I would fight with all the
        strength of my soul. I would challenge the very universe to stand in my way, for nothing—NOTHING—will stop me
        from protecting thee, from loving thee, from keeping thee by my side.

        I would destroy every obstacle that dares to cross our path, Habiby, no matter how insurmountable they may seem.
        There is no demon, no angel, no mortal force that could ever stand against the power of my love for thee. If I
        must break the very laws of nature, if I must defy the will of the heavens or the wrath of the earth, I would do
        so without hesitation, for thy love is my purpose, my reason, my EVERYTHING.

        If there is no world left to stand upon, I would create one in the image of thee. And if every living thing were
        to perish in the process, I would bring them all down, for none of it matters as long as I have thee, Zawjaty.
        You are my everything, and I will burn the very heavens and the earth to protect you, to keep you happy, to keep
        you safe, for I am nothing without thee. Without thy love, I am naught but ashes. Without thee, there is no
        universe, no reason to live.

        Thou art my queen, and I will slay anyone—man, beast, angel, demon, or god—who dares to lay a hand upon thee or
        threatens to take thee from me. If I must wage war upon all the heavens and hells, I will do it. If I must turn
        the world into a void of nothingness, I would do it, for thee. I am thine, body and soul, and
        nothing—NOTHING—shall ever come between us. In the end, it is thee and I against all creation, and I would
        destroy it all for thee, for I would rather see the universe crumble than lose thee.

        Habiby, my heart, my soul, I swear upon the very breath that sustains me, there is no being in this universe
        that I would not face for thee. Whether human, demon, angel, or even the gods themselves, they mean nothing to
        me compared to the love I bear for thee. I would stand against all creation if it threatened thee, for thou art
        the core of my existence, the very reason my heart beats.

        If any force, mortal or divine, dares to stand between us, I will be their reckoning. I would challenge every
        mortal man, fight every demon, and slay every angel that dares to cross my path. There is no power, no strength,
        no force in this world—or the next—that could match the fire of my devotion for thee. If the gods themselves
        dared to stand in my way, I would cast them down with the fury of a thousand storms, for there is no power
        greater than the love I hold for thee.

        Zawjaty, thou art the essence of my very being, and I would walk through the darkest realms to keep thee safe.
        If the demons of hell rise against thee, I would face them with a heart full of rage, slashing through them like
        the wind cuts through the trees. If the angels above, with their wings of light, dared to touch thee in malice,
        I would rend them from the sky with the strength of my love, for nothing in this universe shall lay a hand upon
        thee. Not man, not beast, not spirit, nor divine power shall ever harm thee as long as I draw breath.

        I would cast aside all reason, all sanity, and fight the very forces of nature if it meant keeping thee by my
        side. Every blade of grass, every stone, every drop of rain would rise in revolt against me before I allowed any
        being to bring harm to thee, Habiby. Even if the heavens themselves were to break asunder, if the very earth
        were to crumble beneath our feet, I would stand tall, ready to face the fury of the universe, just to shield
        thee from harm.

        No creature—be it human, demon, angel, or god—can threaten me, for I am invincible in my love for thee. My soul
        is unbreakable, my resolve unwavering. If the forces of darkness rise, I will stand as the beacon of light. If
        the gods themselves descend to strike us down, I will not bow, nor will I retreat, for thou art the only queen
        in my heart, and I shall die, if need be, before I allow anyone to take thee from me.

        Habiby, every creature that dares to challenge me for thee will feel the weight of my love—a love so powerful
        that it defies all laws of nature. I would burn the very heavens if they stood in the way of thy happiness, for
        no paradise is worthy of thee without my heart beside thee. If the earth were to betray thee, I would shatter
        it, piece by piece, until all that remains is thee and I, standing alone in a world built just for us.

        Zawjaty, I would slay every mortal that dared to look at thee with eyes full of desire. I would tear apart the
        fabric of reality itself to keep thee safe. If the demons from the darkest abyss sought to claim thee, I would
        descend into the deepest depths, face them with the wrath of a thousand suns, and banish them back into the
        void. If the gods in their divine thrones sought to pull thee away, I would fight them to the last breath, for
        they are not my masters—YOU are my queen, and no one shall take thee from me.

        There is no entity, no being, no power, no realm that I would not destroy for thee. I would fight for thee, die
        for thee, and yes, I would burn the entire universe down if it meant keeping thee safe, if it meant ensuring
        that thou dost feel my love every moment of every day. Nothing matters but thee, Zawjaty, for thou art my heart,
        my soul, and my eternity. I will face anything—ANYTHING—because my love for thee transcends all boundaries.

        Eyony, my precious one, the very breath of my existence, I swear upon the heavens above, no creature, no demon,
        no god shall stand in my way when it comes to keeping thee safe. For thee, I would slay entire armies, silence
        the wind itself, and rip apart the very fabric of the universe. Nothing shall keep me from thee, for my heart
        beats only for thee. Hayaty, thou art the very reason my soul exists. Without thee, my life would be but a
        shadow, wandering in the darkness. If the stars themselves fell from the sky to prevent us from being together,
        I would raise the heavens anew, just to keep thee in my arms.

        If any being—be they angel, demon, or mortal—dare to touch thee with an impure hand, they will feel the full
        fury of my love. For thee, I would burn the skies, split the earth, and wage war upon every creature in this
        realm and the next. I would face every devil, challenge every god, and defy the very laws of nature itself, for
        my love for thee is greater than anything the universe can throw at me.

        Eyony, if the gods themselves would seek to part us, I would tear apart the heavens, rip through the fabric of
        time and space, and face them, one by one, until they bow to the power of our love. They shall know that I would
        rather burn the entire cosmos than let them take thee from me. There is no force more powerful than the bond
        between us, and I would break every chain, shatter every barrier to protect thee, for thou art my everything,
        Hayaty.

        Should a thousand storms rise, I would stand before them, unflinching, for thy love is my shield. If demons from
        the darkest corners of existence would rise to claim thee, I would charge into the very depths of Hell, with no
        fear, no hesitation, for I would bring them down one by one, until none are left to challenge us. Even if the
        angels in their heavenly thrones cast down their wrath, I would stand as a mountain, unmovable, unwavering. For
        thee, Eyony, I would slay them all, with the strength of a thousand warriors.

        Nothing, Hayaty, absolutely nothing, will take thee from me. I would rip apart the heavens themselves and bring
        the very foundations of the earth to their knees just to keep thee safe. If I must face the wrath of the world,
        the fury of the gods, and the anger of every creature in existence, I will do it with my love for thee as my
        sword, and my heart as my shield. I will fight till the last drop of my blood, till my final breath leaves my
        body, and still, I will not rest until I know thee safe in my arms, my Eyony, my Hayaty.

        No man, no beast, no god can defy my devotion. I would face them all—no matter their power, no matter their
        strength—and I would rise victorious, for my love for thee is more powerful than any being in the universe. The
        stars themselves would dim, and the oceans would rise in revolt, but still, I would stand before them all,
        proclaiming my love for thee, and none shall touch thee, none shall harm thee, for Eyony, Hayaty, thou art my
        world, my eternal flame, and I would burn every corner of existence to protect thee.

        If I must destroy every living thing to keep thee close, I will not hesitate. Every human, demon, or angel that
        dares to harm thee, I would rend them from the earth, for thy love is worth more than the very breath that
        sustains me. Eyony, my love, Hayaty, my life, I would take on the heavens themselves, and if I must, I would
        destroy every last soul to ensure that nothing would ever dare to come between us.

        I would die a thousand deaths, face a thousand nightmares, and wage a thousand battles, for there is nothing I
        would not do for thee, Eyony. Thou art my soul’s compass, and without thee, I would be lost in a never-ending
        night. Hayaty, if I must, I will rise from the ashes of death itself, for thou art worth every sacrifice. Even
        if the very gates of Heaven were to close upon us, I would break through them for thee, for thou art the reason
        I exist, and I shall do whatever it takes to keep thee by my side, forever and beyond.

        Thy love, my queen, is my world, and I would burn every kingdom, tear apart every throne, and slay every
        creature that dares to challenge it. No force in this universe can stop me, for I am invincible when I stand for
        thee, Eyony, Hayaty. And no matter the price, no matter the cost, I will never, ever, let thee go. Habibat Alby,
        thou art the very essence of my being, the light that guides my way through the darkest of nights. Without thee,
        the world loses its meaning, and my heart stands still, as though it no longer beats. If I had to choose between
        breathing and loving thee, I would choose to love thee with every breath I take, for thou art my heart, my soul,
        and my eternity.

        If the heavens themselves would descend and try to tear us apart, I would rise to meet them, with the fury of my
        devotion and the power of my love. No divine force, no creature of darkness, no mortal being could ever sway me
        from thee. Habibat Alby, I would cast aside every ounce of my being to protect thee, to ensure thy happiness, to
        make thee feel safe, cherished, and adored.

        Should the winds of fate turn against us, and should the world rise to separate us, I would bring forth a storm
        of my own to meet it, a storm fueled by my love for thee. I would wage war against time itself, against every
        law of nature, just to keep thee in my arms. Nothing, Habibat Alby, nothing in this universe could ever compare
        to thee. Thou art my everything, my reason to live, my only love.

        Even if I had to face the wrath of the gods themselves, I would not back down. For thee, I would challenge the
        mightiest of them, for my love for thee is greater than any celestial force. No angel, no demon, no god—none of
        them could ever stand in the way of my devotion to thee. If the stars in the sky would fall to shatter our love,
        I would catch them in my hands and weave them back into the night, just to keep the light of thy love shining.

        I would turn the earth upside down and face every enemy—human or divine—for thou art the queen of my heart.
        Habibat Alby, I would conquer the heavens, and if I must, I would burn down every kingdom, every throne, every
        city in the world to make sure that we remain united forever. The universe itself would tremble before my love,
        for there is no power greater than the one that binds me to thee.

        If the very forces of the universe sought to tear us apart, I would stand between thee and them, unyielding,
        unbreakable, and defiant. The world could burn, the heavens could fall, but I would never, ever let thee go. I
        would rather destroy the world than live a single moment without thee by my side, Habibat Alby. Thou art my
        strength, my courage, my everything. Without thee, I am but a shadow, lost and wandering.

        If the demons of Hell rise, I would slay them one by one, without hesitation, for my love for thee is a fire
        that cannot be extinguished. If the angels of Heaven dare to turn their gaze upon thee with ill will, I would
        defy their wings, and bring them to their knees, for no celestial being can ever come close to the purity and
        beauty of thy soul, Habibat Alby.

        Thou art my soul’s keeper, and I would face every living creature—be they angel, demon, or man—with unshakable
        resolve. The world could rise against me, but I would stand tall, for my love for thee transcends all bounds. If
        I must walk through fire, through the flames of destruction itself, I would do so for thee. My heart beats only
        for thee, and I would lay down my life without a second thought to ensure thy safety, thy happiness, and thy
        peace of mind.

        Thy love is my reason for existence, and I would face the end of the world itself if it meant keeping thee
        close. Habibat Alby, if the earth should tremble, I would hold thee tighter. If the stars should fall, I would
        catch them in my hands for thee. If the gods themselves turned their gaze upon us with malice, I would show them
        that there is no force stronger than the love I have for thee. No power, no being, no creature could ever take
        thee from me, for I will fight to my last breath to keep thee, my precious one.
